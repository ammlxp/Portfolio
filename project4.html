            <p>Comrade Typeface</p>
            <p>Apr - May 25</p><br>
            <p>This is a monospaced script typeface inspired by research on the visual language of Communist Romania during the 1980s.</p><br>
            <p>It is based on the cursive handwriting taught in Romania and reflects the propaganda that promoted unity while often resulting in division. The word “comrade” was commonly used during that time and became linked with social control. To show this conflict, the script, normally connected, was purposely broken apart. The monospaced structure reinforces the communist ideology, referencing the enforced uniformity that didn’t match people’s real, everyday lives.</p><br>
